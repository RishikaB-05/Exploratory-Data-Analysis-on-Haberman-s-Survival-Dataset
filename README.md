# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Haberman-s-Survival-Dataset

I'm thrilled to share my latest data endeavor: the creation of Haberman's Survival Dataset using Pandas! This classic dataset, widely used in the realm of survival analysis, offers a treasure trove of insights into the factors influencing survival rates among breast cancer patients.

#üîç Dataset Overview:

‚Ä¢The Haberman's Survival Dataset comprises records from a study conducted at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital between 1958 and 1970.
‚Ä¢Each record contains four key attributes:Age: The age of the patient at the time of surgery.
‚Ä¢Year of Operation: The year in which the surgery was performed (ranging from 1958 to 1969).
‚Ä¢Number of Positive Axillary Nodes: The number of positive axillary lymph nodes detected during surgery.
‚Ä¢Survival Status: This binary attribute denotes whether the patient survived for 5 or more years post-surgery (coded as 1) or succumbed to the disease within 5 years (coded as 2).

#üìà Key Findings:

Data Distribution:
‚Ä¢The age of patients ranges from 30 to 83 years, with a mean age of approximately 52 years.
‚Ä¢The year of operation spans from 1958 to 1969.
‚Ä¢The number of positive axillary nodes detected varies widely, with some patients having no positive nodes and others having as many as 52, with a mean of around 4.
‚Ä¢The dataset is imbalanced, with a larger number of patients surviving beyond 5 years compared to those who did not.
Survival Analysis:
‚Ä¢The majority of patients (around 73%) survived beyond 5 years post-surgery.
‚Ä¢Patients with fewer positive axillary nodes tend to have a higher chance of survival, indicating a potential correlation between the number of positive nodes and survival outcome.
‚Ä¢There is no clear trend observed between age and survival status, although a slight increase in the number of patients who did not survive is seen in older age groups.
